    <p>My name has an 'h' in the middle. I am proud of the 'h'. I like the  'h'. It sets me apart. Hailing from rainy yet wonderful Portland, Oregon, sharing a fun home with a goofy  fiance, 3 cats named after 'Ghostbusters' characters (Zuul, Vinz Clortho and the newly adopted Sloar), and 2 roommates.</p>

    <p>I have always been artistic. My parents bought me all kinds of art supplies as a kid. When I went to college I majored in Art History, but quickly realized that I still enjoyed working in art and Graphic Design allowed me to not only create art, but get actual work/paid doing it after graduation. So I switched and ended up with a bachelor's degree in graphic design. This was in the late 90s, back when print was still king.</p>
    <p>After graduating, I found myself struggling to find work. At some points I was able to find work as a print designer, but as time went on, it was more difficult finding anything consistent. I decided to return to school after a long hiatus. Probably one of the best decisions I could have made. This time around, I am majoring in Web Design &amp; Development. My career growth has seen it's ups and downs over the years. I freelanced for quite a few year sand also worked full time for some companies around town. After working for 6 years at an Apple Store as a technician, I decided to join the Squarespace PDX team as a Customer Operations/Technical Support Advisor. The last 6 months have flown by.</p>
